# Containerized Deployment Workflow for Microservices on AWS

This project provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide for deploying containerized microservices using AWS services. It walks you through the entire process from containerization to automated deployment.

## Deployment Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of the following key steps:

### 1. Docker Containerization
- Create optimized Dockerfiles for each microservice
- Build and test containers locally
- Implement multi-stage builds for production-ready images

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Setup
- Deploy network infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups) using CloudFormation
- Create ECR repositories to store Docker images
- Set up ECS cluster, services, and task definitions

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- Configure CodeBuild for continuous integration
- Set up CodeDeploy for automated deployments
- Implement blue/green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

### 4. Deployment and Testing
- Use deployment scripts to automate the entire process
- Test the deployment with health checks
- Monitor application performance with CloudWatch

### 5. Maintenance and Cleanup
- Monitor the application using CloudWatch
- Implement proper cleanup procedures to avoid unnecessary costs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS account with appropriate permissions

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-3.git
   cd project-3
   ```

2. Run the local deployment script:
   ```bash
   # For Windows
   .\scripts\deploy-local.bat
   
   # For Linux/Mac
   ./scripts/deploy-local.sh
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost

### AWS Deployment

1. Set up the AWS infrastructure:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\setup-aws-infrastructure.bat
   ```

2. Deploy the application to AWS:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\deploy-aws.bat
   ```

3. Verify the deployment:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\verify-deployment.bat
   ```

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All AWS resources are defined using CloudFormation templates
- **Containerization**: Microservices are containerized using Docker best practices
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build and deployment process
- **Blue/Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with CodeDeploy
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration for logs and metrics
- **Security**: Proper IAM roles and security groups

## Cleanup

When you're done with the deployment and want to avoid unnecessary costs:

```bash
.\scripts\cleanup-aws.bat
```

# Deployment and Testing Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for deploying and testing your containerized microservices on AWS.

## Deployment Scripts

### Step 1: Local Docker Deployment

For local testing before AWS deployment:

For Linux/Mac users, use the `deploy-local.sh` script:
```bash
./deploy-local.sh
```

For Windows users, use the `deploy-local.bat` script:
```bash
.\deploy-local.bat
```

Remember to make the shell scripts executable if you're using Linux/Mac systems:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Step 2: AWS Deployment

To deploy your microservices to AWS:

For Linux/Mac users:
```bash
./deploy-aws.sh
```

For Windows users:
```bash
.\deploy-aws.bat
```

This will:
1. Build and push Docker images to ECR
2. Update ECS task definitions
3. Deploy using blue/green deployment strategy

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

To verify your deployment health:

```bash
.\verify-deployment.bat
```

### Step 4: Cleanup Resources

When you're done with your deployment and want to avoid unnecessary costs:

```bash
.\cleanup-aws.bat
```

## Additional Scripts

- `setup-aws-infrastructure.bat`: Sets up the initial AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation
- `update-task-definitions.bat`: Updates ECS task definitions
- `monitor-deployment.bat`: Monitors the deployment and shows CloudWatch logs
```

These files provide a comprehensive framework for containerized microservices deployment on AWS, including:

1. Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
2. Local development environment with Docker Compose
3. AWS infrastructure setup with CloudFormation
4. CI/CD pipeline with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy
5. Blue/green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
6. Monitoring and health checks
7. Proper cleanup procedures

The project structure follows best practices for microservices architecture and provides a complete end-to-end deployment workflow.
