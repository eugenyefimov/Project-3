# Containerized Deployment Workflow for Microservices on AWS

This project provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide for deploying containerized microservices using AWS services. It walks you through the entire process from containerization to automated deployment.

## Deployment Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of the following key steps:

### 1. Docker Containerization
- Create optimized Dockerfiles for each microservice
- Build and test containers locally
- Implement multi-stage builds for production-ready images

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Setup
- Deploy network infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups) using CloudFormation
- Create ECR repositories to store Docker images
- Set up ECS cluster, services, and task definitions

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- Configure CodeBuild for continuous integration
- Set up CodeDeploy for automated deployments
- Implement blue/green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

### 4. Deployment and Testing
- Use deployment scripts to automate the entire process
- Test the deployment with health checks
- Monitor application performance with CloudWatch

### 5. Maintenance and Cleanup
- Monitor the application using CloudWatch
- Implement proper cleanup procedures to avoid unnecessary costs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS account with appropriate permissions

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-3.git
   cd project-3
   ```

2. Run the local deployment script:
   ```bash
   # For Windows
   .\scripts\deploy-local.bat
   
   # For Linux/Mac
   ./scripts/deploy-local.sh
   ```
   
   Note: Remember to make the shell scripts executable if you're using Linux/Mac systems:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost

### AWS Deployment

1. Set up the AWS infrastructure:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\setup-aws-infrastructure.bat
   ```

2. Deploy the application to AWS:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\deploy-aws.bat
   ```

3. Verify the deployment:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\verify-deployment.bat
   ```

4. Set up monitoring:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\setup-monitoring.bat
   ```

5. Access your application using the load balancer DNS name provided in the verification output.
